# Preface

This document is meant to be a collaborative discussion of the best practices in C++. It compliments books such as Effective C++ (Meyers) and C++ Coding Standards (Alexandrescu, Sutter). We fill in some of the lower level details that they don't discuss and provide specific stylistic recommendations while also discussing how to ensure overall code quality.

In all cases brevity and succinctness is prefered. Examples are prefered for making the case for why one option is prefered over another. If necessary, words will be used.
